Those are my notes during the LEARN 5th workshop at Barcelona. Some of them are
 more valuable for my PhD, while other are oriented to my day-job on research
 data management. Both are so closely related that it'd make no sense to keep
 separate notes for them.

**xyz abc** from (Science Europe)[http://scienceeurope.org] briefly talked about
machine actionable data management plans. She did it so briefly, that I only realized
she did so after Daniel Mietchen remarked it later in his talk.

However, xyz talked more in detail about other new (for me) topic: **Domain Data
Protocols**. DDPs takes further the idea of disciplinary standards interoperability,
being a kind of set of best practices for any given domain. In some sense they're
something like a Research Data Management Policy for disciplines.

This is a very powerful idea, generalizing standards from data, schemas and metadata to full
workflows. It reasonate very much with my idea of formalized DMPs.

This figure depicts DMPs at the intersection of an organization and a domain policies.
It seems to me that DDP will set mainly **what** to do, while the organization RDM policy will
set mainly **how** to do it. A little later Daniel went further on this idea, casually, when
he talked about Intersection of Policies (more on this later).

Then was the turn of **Daniel Mietchen** from NIH. He not only reviewed the previous speakers,
but went through a number of topics and details on research data management. Two things resonated strongly
with me; first, his emphasis on making machine-enabled research data management plans. This idea is at the
very core of my PhD research (goals/introduction to be published in this blog), how else could we
orchestrate services around a DMP? Second, his review on Intersection of Policies, much more complete
than my picture above shows. Learn more at his github **TODO**
