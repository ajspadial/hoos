Those are some of my notes during the [LEARN 5th workshop at Barcelona](http://learn-rdm.eu/en/workshops/5th-learn-workshop/). Some of them are
 more valuable for my PhD, while other are oriented to my day-job on research
 data management. Both are so closely related that it'd make no sense to keep
 separate notes for them.

**Marie Timmermann** from (Science Europe)[http://scienceeurope.org] briefly talked about
machine actionable data management plans. She did it so briefly, that I only realized
she did so after Daniel Mietchen remarked it later in his talk.

However, Marie introduced a very interesting (for me) topic in her talk: **Domain Data
Protocols**. DDPs take the idea of disciplinary standards interoperability further,
being a kind of set of best practices for any given domain. In some sense, they're
something like a Research Data Management Policy for disciplines.

This is a very powerful idea, generalizing standards from data, schemas and metadata to full
workflows. It reasonate very much with my idea of formalized DMPs.

This figure depicts <abbr title="Data Management Plans">DMPs</abbr> at the intersection of an organization's and a domain policies.  
It seems to me that <abbr title="Domain Data Policies">DDPs</abbr> will set mainly **what** to do, while the organization RDM policy will
set mainly **how** to do it. A little later Daniel Mietchen went further on this idea, casually, when
he talked about Interaction of Policies (more on this later).

Then was the turn of [**Daniel Mietchen**](http://twitter.com/EvoMRI) from NIH. He not only reviewed the previous speakers,
but went through a number of topics and details about research data management state of the art. Two things resonated strongly
with me:
* first, his emphasis on making machine-enabled research data management plans. This idea is at the very core of my PhD research (goals/introduction to be published in this blog), how else could we
orchestrate services around a <abbr title="Data Management Plan">DMP</abbr>? As a reference for this idea he brought [those slides by Stephannie Simms from DCL](http://www.slideshare.net/StephanieSimms/making-dmps-actionable-and-public). I'll go over them soon, with my thoughts and notes.
* Second, his review on Interaction of Policies, much more complete
than my picture above shows. [Learn more at his github](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/talks/blob/master/5th-LEARN-workshop-2017.md#interactions-of-policies)
