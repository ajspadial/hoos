This is a very preliminar - and probably na√Øve - framework I'm using to think about DMPs, and how to model them. There's a row for each stage in the research data life cycle(TODO: reference).
The columns are reserved for each one of the 5W questions (6 in this case).

|               | what | who | when | where | how | why |
|---------------|------|-----|------|-------|-----|-----|
| creation      |      |     |      |       |     |     |
| processing    |      |     |      |       |     |     |
| analysis      |      |     |      |       |     |     |
| preservation  |      |     |      |       |     |     |
| sharing       |      |     |      |       |     |     |
| reuse         |      |     |      |       |     |     |

I have still to put some effort to detail what elements are valid questions for each W question, for example: storage for where, or permissions for who.

*It tooks me 10 days to go from draft to really posting, w/o no major change, this silly note. I have to do something with my workflow*
